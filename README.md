# Smart-Urban-Garden
Smart Urban Garden
An eco-friendly, IoT-powered gardening system that uses smart sensors, and Arduino IoT Cloud to automate irrigation and monitor plant health — designed to combat food insecurity caused by urbanization and illegal mining.

📌 Inspiration
With rising urbanization and the destructive impact of illegal mining, many communities face food shortages due to poor soil quality and lack of sustainable agriculture practices. We built this solution to show that with minimal resources and technology, anyone can grow food sustainably — even in the smallest urban spaces.

🧠 What It Does
Smart Urban Garden monitors:

🌡️ Temperature & Humidity (DHT22)

🌿 Soil Moisture

☀️ Sunlight Intensity

💧 Water Level (Ultrasonic Sensor)

It automatically waters the plants when the soil is dry and provides real-time updates to the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.

🛠️ How We Built It
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno R4

Cloud Platform: Arduino IoT Cloud

Sensors:

DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity)

Soil Moisture Sensor

LDR (Light Intensity)

Actuators: 5V Relay + Water Pump

LCD: 20x4 I2C Display

Materials: Locoboard , pipes, and wooden supports.
